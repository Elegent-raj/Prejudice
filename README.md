# Prejudice
A web app for predicting political and ideological prejudice, with the help of data fed in the form of queries.

In the present scnerio of upcoming elections, people are pretty confused about their political ideology.
I wish to aid them in determining their political inclination towards the available options available on the basis of the political party's pre-election agenda, promises and their performance in the past.
We could use weighted average of the various factors as a measure.
The main focus is to provide the result for every option and the probability of matching their ideology with them.

Wish to work and complete this as soon as possible.
I can work with javascript,HTML,CSS,blender,Java and C++(Practise - Java>C++).
Hope this helps.
